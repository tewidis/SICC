    * Software defined networking
    * Cloud system software
    * Cloud applications
    * Network functions virtualization
3. Format:
    * Lecture
    * Workshop
    * Project

## Software Defined Networking

1. Introduction to cloud computing
    * Origin, benefits, security issues in cloud computing
2. Basics of network virtualization
    * Physical datacenter network topologies, traffic engineering, SDN
3. Case study: Azure networking
    * Study how networking is done in datacenters that run Azure
4. Network performance
    * Measuring network metrics (latency, bandwidth, scalability, utilization)
5. Project: Design, implement, and test a software defined network for a
distributed server to cater to a variety of requests

## Cloud System Software

1. Programming frameworks
    * Software for developing distributed and parallel cloud applications
    * MapReduce, Hadoop
2. Virtualization of system services
    * Virtualization, virtual machines, hypervisors, VM management, RPC, and
    functional debugging of distributed systems
3. Cloud storage
    * Distributed file systems (GFS), key-value stores, and NoSQL storage such
    as Dynamo
4. Resource management
    * Automated provisioning, load balancing, scheduling, and elastic systems
5. Scalability
    * Benchmarking and scalabliity considerations
6. Project: Implement a MapReduce framework using Azure services
    * Make MapReduce runtime implementation

## Cloud Applications

1. Use cases
    * Uses for large-scale cloud computing applications
2. Resiliency
    * Fault tolerance, incremental deployment, software upgrades, recovery
3. Emerging cloud applications
    * Internet of things, stream processing
4. Trending cloud infrastructures
    * Fog computing, geo-distributed computing infrastructure, latency-sensitive
    applications such as distributed camera networks
5. Project: Open-ended application

## Network Functions Virtualization

1. Network functions
    * Commonly deployed network functions (firewalls, VPN gateways, SPAM filters,
    web proxies, etc.)
2. Enablers for NFV
    * Definitions, technology enablers, NFV architecture, design considerations
3. NFV and SDN
    * Relationship between NFV and SDN and related challenges
4. NFV Case Studies
    * Study different uses and pitfalls of NFV (NFV is still in progress)
5. Project: Implement specific services and analyze pros and cons of doing the
project in the cloud
